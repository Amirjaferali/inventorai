# InventorAI — Active Increment Contract

**Purpose:** the single, fixed location where the currently active phase/increment contract
is declared, plus the reusable contract template. Future agents discover the active contract
here (referenced from `CLAUDE.md` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE.md`). Only one contract is
"active" at a time. When a new increment is authorized, replace the "Active contract"
section (append-only history is kept in the roadmap, not here).

---

## Declaration rule

- The **active contract** is whatever is recorded in the "Active contract" section below.
- An increment is authorized only by committed owner authorization; a contract here without
  such authorization is a template/placeholder, not an authorization.
- A contract governs bounded work at DEPTH 2/LEVEL 2 (and DEPTH 3/LEVEL 3 maintenance inside
  it). LEVEL 1 changes always need separate explicit owner authorization regardless of any
  contract.

## Reusable contract template

```
INCREMENT CONTRACT — <name>
Objective:                <what this increment achieves>
Owner authorization:      <reference to the committed owner authorization>
Risk level:               <LEVEL 1 | LEVEL 2 | LEVEL 3>
Allowed paths:            <exact paths that may change>
Forbidden paths:          <exact paths that must not change; default: engine/, web/, tests/,
                           domains/, database/, schemas/, prompts/, scripts/, CI, runtime/deploy,
                           main, accepted evidence>
Expected behavior:        <observable outcome>
Non-goals:                <explicitly out of scope>
Acceptance criteria:      <testable/verifiable gates>
Required tests:           <tests that must pass; or "none — documentation-only">
Tests not required:       <what is deliberately not tested>
Dependencies:             <prior gates, decisions, foundations>
Unresolved decisions:     <owner decisions still open, if any>
Stop conditions:          <when to stop and escalate>
Independent-review scope: <bounded reviewer questions per protocol §5>
Merge authority:          <who authorizes merge; default: owner, separately>
```

## Active contract

**Status:** NO ACTIVE CONTRACT. **Verified authoritative branch:** `feature/atomic-json-session-persistence`.
**Verified authoritative tip:** `82cf45f94cf6a9701e10ad02c2f2d557add1ed55` (Merge PR #345 — G-UX-GUIDED-LABEL;
always re-resolve the live tip from Git). Since the PR #327 gate, the bounded **remediation program** was
authorized and is now **FORMALLY CLOSED** (executable track COMPLETE): G-R01 CLOSED via PR #329/#330; DISC-007
CLOSED via PR #331 (Domain Registry v1.0 test reconciliation) and PR #332 (v1.0 validation hardening); tip at that
closure `239557e1` (PR #332 merge); repository-wide XPASS `0`; deferred Domain Registry v1.0 rules FORMALLY DEFERRED
— NOT IMPLEMENTED — NOT SOLVED. See `docs/governance/evidence/phase3_owner_decisions/REMEDIATION_PROGRAM_FORMAL_CLOSURE.md`.
**Since then, the following bounded gates have been separately owner-authorized, executed, merged, post-merge
verified, and FORMALLY CLOSED** (separate-session independent review is recorded in the respective owner
authorizations for these gates, except **PR #341 — G-PDSR**, for which merge, post-merge verification, and owner
closure are verified but a separate-session independent-review record and a letter verdict were not independently
located from inspectable PR evidence) (full merge SHAs; enumerated in
`docs/governance/evidence/phase3_owner_decisions/POST_PHASE_3_UX_IMPLEMENTATION_GATES_FORMAL_CLOSURE.md`):
PR #338 Phase 3E–3F governance sync (`a7a141ce7f25eab261e29a3e44930b76a9e7c1f4`); PR #339 G-IRB
(`fa054abe8979d9f1fe63fe9ca3122d9ce9df7078`); PR #340 G-SC0 (`94b6b9df61d655a9005599e1e18fe19de26e7338`);
PR #341 G-PDSR (`745aaaf77aaad838d418f597710194f61db3c98e`); PR #342 G-UX-SHELL
(`43453ceb87936d3a041e6edcccc0e7a8f16237a7`); PR #343 G-UX-TRUST (`cc71ab7acb39d9f772dbb1a347c78bc53f86beae`);
PR #344 G-UX-ENTRY (`41e51ba070c71e9a1ca1c351a680abb73d72204e`); PR #345 G-UX-GUIDED-LABEL
(`82cf45f94cf6a9701e10ad02c2f2d557add1ed55`). Current active work: **NONE** — no implementation work is presently
authorized; the next gate requires **separate explicit owner authorization**. Phase 3F bounded implementation
broadly, **Phase 4, WS17, and STG remain NOT AUTHORIZED / NOT STARTED**. The block below is retained as the prior
completed contract of record (Audit-Disposition & Lean-Governance gate, PR #327).

```
INCREMENT CONTRACT — Audit Disposition & Handover-Gap Canonicalization + Lean-Governance Adoption   [CLOSED — PR #327]
Objective:                Documentation-only canonicalization of the historical audit
                          disposition, the handover-to-repository gaps (DISC-001…018), the
                          deferred output/visualization capabilities (ACV/Download/Email), the
                          Phase 3B owner-decision agenda, stale-document clarification, and the
                          Lean Governance & Agent Continuity Protocol with its registers.
Owner authorization:      Owner messages "AUDIT DISPOSITION AND HANDOVER-GAP CANONICALIZATION"
                          and "LEAN GOVERNANCE AND AGENT CONTINUITY ADOPTION" (this gate).
Risk level:               Documentation-only (no code risk level; governance change).
Allowed paths:            docs/governance/** (new phase3_owner_decisions/ records; protocol,
                          state, register, contract, handover; append-only STALE_DOCUMENT_REGISTER,
                          plan, roadmap); CLAUDE.md (bounded boot-section); MVP_SCOPE_FREEZE.md
                          (append-only bounded allowance); root banners on NEXT_SESSION.md,
                          FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md, VALIDATION_LOG.md, GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md.
Forbidden paths:          engine/, web/, tests/, domains/, database/, schemas/, prompts/,
                          scripts/, CI/workflow, runtime/deploy config, main, raw outputs
                          (incl. replay_debug.txt), accepted owner-decision/closure evidence
                          except the append-only edits listed above.
Expected behavior:        No runtime/product change. Governance clarity and lean continuity only.
Non-goals:                No Phase 3 activation; no Phase 3B decisions; no ACV/Download/Email/
                          sponsor/notice/privacy/Arabic-RTL/accessibility/STG design or impl.
Acceptance criteria:      Exact scope; forbidden paths unchanged; roadmap append-only; banners
                          do not overstate; phase allocations consistent; no capability described
                          as implemented; owner notes carried forward; no later gate activated.
Required tests:           None — documentation-only; DOCUMENTED NO-VALID-RED.
Tests not required:       Application/pytest execution (forbidden here).
Dependencies:             Phase 1 & 2 formally closed; OD-R/OD-S; live tip verification.
Unresolved decisions:     Phase 3B UX choices remain open (agenda-staged, not decided here).
Stop conditions:          Any forbidden-path change; base drift; a Level-1 need; a material
                          contradiction — stop and escalate.
Independent-review scope: Per protocol §5, plus: banners accurate; carve-out bounded; no
                          implementation authority granted; roadmap prefix preserved.
Merge authority:          Owner, separately (not by the execution agent).
