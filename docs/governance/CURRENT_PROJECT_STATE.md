# InventorAI — Current Project State

**Purpose:** the concise current-state entry point for every agent. It is **not** a second
roadmap. For detail, see the canonical plan
(`docs/governance/PRODUCT_FOUNDATION_AND_COMMERCIAL_READINESS_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`), the
append-only `ACTIVE_EXECUTION_ROADMAP.md`, and the accepted owner-decision evidence indexed
by `docs/governance/OWNER_DECISION_REGISTER.md`.
**Keep concise; refresh at each phase/increment boundary.**

## Authoritative pointers

- **Authoritative branch:** `feature/atomic-json-session-persistence`.
- **Live tip:** resolve from Git each session
  (`git rev-parse origin/feature/atomic-json-session-persistence`). Do **not** trust a
  prose-pinned SHA.
  - **Current authoritative branch tip (last independently verified):**
    `17128f98a677913a71e4978c2e205ef75e9a5845` (Merge PR #336 — Phase 3C governance-record
    synchronization) — the base on which the Phase 3D governance-record synchronization candidate is
    prepared (candidate not yet reviewed/merged).
  - **Historical verified evidence tip:** `0330273b0d8b15fc66a285bcb9b866c6aa81b8e5`
    (PR #327 merge) — **historical evidence only; not the current tip.**
- **`main`:** `0e89e4636399760965c9ff8086b465c90dbadf8e` — STALE / UNRECONCILED / NOT authority.

## Phase and gate

- **Phase 1:** FORMALLY CLOSED. **Phase 2:** FORMALLY CLOSED (PR #325) and status-synchronized (PR #326).
- **Phase 3 (Product UX/UI foundation) — product-decision lane:** **Phase 3A FORMALLY CLOSED**;
  **Phase 3B product-decision scope FORMALLY COMPLETE AND CLOSED** (Phase 3B-1 D1–D4 and Phase 3B-2
  D5–D17 accepted and closed; the **Project Technology Profile** decision — the final proved residual —
  accepted; all 32 agenda items + owner notes A–F dispositioned). These were **owner-accepted decisions
  delivered outside the repository and not previously committed**; their accepted summaries and provenance
  are recorded (by reference/hash) in
  `docs/governance/evidence/phase3_owner_decisions/PHASE_3B_PRODUCT_DECISION_FORMAL_CLOSURE.md`
  (synchronized to committed governance via **PR #335**, merged and post-merge verified).
- **Phase 3C (low-fidelity, non-production UX direction): PRODUCT/UX DECISION FORMALLY ACCEPTED AND CLOSED**
  (owner verdict A; D1–D17 and PTP-D1…D12 preserved, not reopened); recorded in
  `docs/governance/evidence/phase3_owner_decisions/PHASE_3C_LOW_FIDELITY_UX_FORMAL_ACCEPTANCE_AND_CLOSURE.md`
  and synchronized to committed governance via **PR #336** (merged and post-merge verified).
- **Phase 3D (independent usability & accessibility review): INDEPENDENT REVIEW ACCEPTED AND CLOSED**
  (reviewer verdict B — passes with non-blocking observations; owner verdict A; zero blocking findings; no Phase 3C
  surface returned for correction). Findings P3D-N1…P3D-N9 adopted as **Phase 3E acceptance criteria** (P3D-N1 the
  Phase 3E entry criterion); P3D-N10 is governance housekeeping resolved by this synchronization. Recorded in
  `docs/governance/evidence/phase3_owner_decisions/PHASE_3D_INDEPENDENT_UX_REVIEW_FORMAL_ACCEPTANCE_AND_CLOSURE.md`.
  **Phase 3E–3F: NOT AUTHORIZED / NOT STARTED** (each requires a separate explicit owner authorization; Phase 3E
  owner acceptance of the exact design is merely the next eligible gate).
- **Phases 4–10:** NOT STARTED / NOT AUTHORIZED.
- **Completed gate:** Audit-Disposition & Handover-Gap Canonicalization + Lean-Governance
  adoption — **FORMALLY CLOSED** (merged via PR #327, merge `0330273b`; independent review
  `B — PASS WITH NON-BLOCKING OBSERVATIONS`; owner ACCEPTED AS-IS; post-merge PASS).
- **Latest completed gate:** the current bounded **remediation program** — **FORMALLY
  CLOSED** (executable track COMPLETE; G-R01 CLOSED via PR #329/#330; DISC-007 CLOSED via
  PR #331 test reconciliation + PR #332 v1.0 validation hardening; last verified tip
  `239557e1` (PR #332 merge); repository-wide XPASS `0`; one governed ADR-003 xfail retained;
  deferred Domain Registry v1.0 rules FORMALLY DEFERRED — NOT SOLVED). This closes only the
  remediation program; **Phase 3 remains NOT AUTHORIZED**. See
  `docs/governance/evidence/phase3_owner_decisions/REMEDIATION_PROGRAM_FORMAL_CLOSURE.md`.
- **Lean Governance and Agent Continuity Protocol:** **MERGED AND EFFECTIVE** on the
  authoritative branch (this document, the Owner Decision Register, the Active Increment
  Contract, and the Handover Template are now the binding continuity inputs).
- **Current active work:** the **Phase 3D governance-record synchronization** documentation candidate
  (this closure record + status updates) — **PENDING bounded independent review (Lean §5) and owner acceptance;
  no push/PR/merge performed or authorized**. (The Phase 3B and Phase 3C synchronizations are complete — merged via
  PR #335 and PR #336 respectively, both post-merge verified.) No implementation authority.
- **Next proposed gate (not started, not authorized here):** after this Phase 3D synchronization is reviewed and
  accepted, a separate explicit owner authorization of **Phase 3E** (owner acceptance of the exact design), which must
  begin from one consolidated corrected UX specification (P3D-N1) and satisfy the adopted acceptance criteria
  P3D-N1…P3D-N9. A separate explicit owner authorization is required before any Phase 3E step; Phase 3E is not started
  or authorized.

## Product / runtime distinction

- **Product identity:** multi-domain and cross-domain idea-development platform.
- **Current experimental MVP runtime:** Electronics/Electrical only.
- **Product state:** `DEMO_READY_WITH_LIMITATIONS`. **Production ready:** NO. **Deployment authority:** NONE.
- **Historical implementation:** MATERIALLY CONFORMING (independent audit verdict
  `B — MATERIAL CONFORMANCE WITH DOCUMENTATION DRIFT`; see OD-T).

## Implemented capabilities (current)

- Deterministic engine (scoring, progression, gaps, safety signals) — transport-free core.
- Flask app; Path N guided journey; electronics/electrical admission gate; decision workspace;
  success-criteria; deliverable view; FDC-001 narrow canonical-JSON decision-record export.
- In-memory `SESSION_STORE` only.

## Not implemented / not authorized

- Durable persistence; accounts; authentication; authorization; billing/subscription.
- ACV (Approximate Concept Visualization); Direct Output Download (PDF); Email Delivery.
- Sponsors/themes; administrative notice; privacy-control implementation; full Arabic/RTL;
  accessibility; multi-domain runtime; Path T / FORM T (BLOCKED).
- Structured Technical Guidance — RESERVED / INACTIVE / separately authorized.

## Accepted limitations (honest, not waived)

End-to-end runtime invocation not certified; `main` stale/unreconciled; `/tmp` transcript
handling (Phase 4 remediation); `iot_electronics` latent/legacy (not loaded; future
separately authorized domain-activation workstream); durable persistence not implemented —
runtime remains in-memory (G-R02; Phase 4); narrow Arabic/RTL. Full register: OD-T and the
canonical plan. (The former `tests/test_domain_registry.py` ~31 failing baseline is RESOLVED
— DISC-007 CLOSED via the current bounded remediation program; suite `0 failed`, XPASS `0`;
deferred Domain Registry v1.0 hardening rules remain FORMALLY DEFERRED — NOT IMPLEMENTED —
NOT SOLVED; see the Remediation Program Formal Closure Record.)

## Active holds / forbidden work now

No implementation, UI, runtime, engine, schema, database, prompt/AI, tests-as-gates,
domain activation, ACV/Download/Email, sponsors/notice/privacy implementation, Arabic/RTL,
accessibility, Structured Technical Guidance, exact/production design, Phase 3E–3F activation, WS17,
main reconciliation, or PR merge is authorized by the current gate. (Phase 3A/3B product decisions, the
Phase 3C low-fidelity UX direction, and the Phase 3D independent review are closed; Phase 3E requires a
separate explicit owner authorization; no exact/production design, coded prototype, or implementation is
authorized by the Phase 3C/3D acceptances.)

## Open owner decisions

None blocking the current gate. The Phase 3B owner UX/product decisions staged in
`docs/governance/evidence/phase3_owner_decisions/PHASE_3B_OWNER_DECISION_AGENDA.md` are now **DECIDED and
CLOSED** (all 32 items + owner notes A–F dispositioned; D1–D17 + the Project Technology Profile accepted);
see `PHASE_3B_PRODUCT_DECISION_FORMAL_CLOSURE.md`. The Phase 3C low-fidelity UX direction is **ACCEPTED and CLOSED**
(see `PHASE_3C_LOW_FIDELITY_UX_FORMAL_ACCEPTANCE_AND_CLOSURE.md`), and the Phase 3D independent review is **ACCEPTED
and CLOSED** (see `PHASE_3D_INDEPENDENT_UX_REVIEW_FORMAL_ACCEPTANCE_AND_CLOSURE.md`; P3D-N1…P3D-N9 adopted as Phase 3E
acceptance criteria). The only open owner decision is whether to authorize the next Product-Foundation gate (Phase 3E —
owner acceptance of the exact design), which is **not** authorized here.
